# Guidelines

Each suggestion will require a certain [👍] reaction number amount, before the suggestion is taken into consideration (with 800 daily visitors, it should be feesable)

React with a [👍] if a suggestion is something you also want, this helps me see who wants what, and what is in demand

Finally, you may comment on a suggestion, just stay on topic, if not - discussions may be closed

Also, more importantly - Some suggestions will be closed if they don't recieve enough support, or the suggestion doesn't follow guidelines or best intrest, and if they go off-topic.
