## Where to Download SolidWorks?  
You can download the required files from:  
- **[SolidWorks 2024](https://getintopc.com/softwares/3d-cad/solidworks-2024-free-download/)**  
- **[SolidWorks 2023](https://getintopc.com/softwares/analysis/solidworks-2023-free-download/)**  
- **[SolidWorks 2021](https://getintopc.com/softwares/3d-cad/solidworks-2021-free-download/)** (Tested for this guide)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This guide is based on the 2021 version, so newer versions may have slight differences. If you face major issues, open an **Issue**!  

### Important Requirements  
- **Windows OS** (Mac/Linux not supported)  
- **Microsoft Excel (Activated & Accessible)** – Required for SolidWorks to function  

### Alternative Links  
If the 2021 link fails, try this [archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210727190509/https://getintopc.com/softwares/3d-cad/solidworks-2021-free-download/). No guarantee it will work.  

> [!TIP]
> **Direct Linking Issues?**  
> If you encounter `ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID`, manually search:  
> **[Google: SolidWorks Cracked GetIntoPC](https://www.google.com/search?q=solidworks+cracked+getintopc)**  
> - Click the **first** result (must be `https://getintopc.com`)  
> - Avoid phishing sites!  

> **Hosting Suggestion Needed**  
> I want to host the 16GB file myself to reduce malware risk, but I don’t have donations to fund it.  
> **Know a free hosting solution?** Open an **Issue → New Suggestion** and share your ideas!

## Common Issues & Fixes  

### **License Error (-8 544 0)**  
- This is a Windows bug related to **[KB3072630](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/ms15-074-vulnerability-in-windows-installer-service-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-july-14-2015-f8098b21-9ab7-a0a6-bddb-a287351f4665)**  
- **No proper fix exists** – Using the **2021 version** is recommended.  
- This issue is **not caused by me** but by the software host.  

### **FlexNet Server Failure (Invalid Hostname)**  
FlexNet crashes if your hostname contains non-English characters (e.g., `ö`). To fix it:  

1. Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator  
2. Run:  
   ```cmd
   wmic computersystem where name="%computername%" call rename name="NewHostname"
   ```  
3. Restart your system & FlexNet server.
