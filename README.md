## Where to install the required files?
You can go to this [website](https://getintopc.com/softwares/3d-cad/solidworks-2024-free-download/) to download the cracked files, this is the link for the 2024 version, this guide is tested on the 2021 version found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210727190509/https://getintopc.com/softwares/3d-cad/solidworks-2021-free-download/) which means you may get minor differences, if something is major, please open a issue!
Only Windows and you must have microsoft excel installed and accessable with a valid license to operate.

## Quick Note
A AI has generated a updated easier to understand .md file of this instruction set, you may view it if you wan't.

Also a great way to do this setup is to watch the video tutorial on the installation found in this repository.

Leave a Star please :)

It is compulsory to have a activated license of Microsoft Excel, you may crack it, but solidworks requires it to be functional.

I'm really happy that this is the top repo when searched up on google, BUT can you please check out my other projects?

## Common Issues

- If a `Could not obtain a license for solidworks standard (-8 544 0)` error pops up, that is normal for windows it is a bug with code [KB3072630](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/ms15-074-vulnerability-in-windows-installer-service-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-july-14-2015-f8098b21-9ab7-a0a6-bddb-a287351f4665) which made windows actually treat Solidworks as a system modification software, Their is no known fix that properly works, I advice using the 2021 version - Issue is not from me but the pirated software website hoster itself.

## Steps to activate

1) Disable your internet, this is to stop the software from running checks on itself during installation

2) Turn off your antivirus, crack files are reported as false positives and in the setup they may interfere and cause file corruption, disable all your antivirus fully, do this with caution and care and be careful during setup

3) Extract the zip file to a easy to access location, the zip files password is 123

4) Enter the folder that was extracted and enter the only folder again

5) you should now see the following: A DVD/ISO Folder, A Normal folder, and SFV file

6) Enter the normal folder to find another zip file, extract it in the same directory and navigate to the extracted folder to check the files

7) You should see 3 folders (2 of which are program files and another a server), 2 registry entries and a txt file

8) Cut the extracted folder from step 6 and go to the main installed directory which you chose in step 3, and paste it there, note that you may get a error where to files are the same, click replace if the error pops up

9) Enter the folder and locate the registry entries, right click the networks_serial_licensing first and click merge, click allow if prompted, you are supposed to get a success message, if not open a issue please

10) Now copy the Flexnet_Server folder and go to your C:\ drive and locate where windows saves the program files (usually C:\Program Files) and paste the copied folder there

11) Enter the copied folder and right click the server_install.bat file and run as admin, if that option is not found you can open cmd as administrator, navigate to the directory using cd and runing the program by using the command .\server_install.bat (or the name of the server installer), after that wait until installation then close by typing anything when prompted to,

12) Navigate to the location set at step 3 and do step 4 again, and extract the ISO/DVD file we checked at step 5 into the same directory

13) Open the extracted folder, and locate the setup executable and run as administrator

14) Once the installer appears, click next, and you will find out all the required serial numbers are typed in, click next and dont change the serial numbers

15) A warning will pop up, click cancel

16) A new menu will appear called summary, accept the T&C in the checkbox and click Install Now, You will get a warning about the port, you may safely press next

17) Once completed make sure to say no to the improvement programme, and click finish

18) A restart pop-up will occur, click restart later

19) Go to the location in step 7 and locate the Program files folder enter it, and you should see another folder, enter that folder then copy its contents and paste it to the corresponding folder in the C:\ drive, so Program Files contents should go to C:\Program Files made by solidworks installer and should replace all files and same thing for the Program (x86)

20) Repeat step 19 but for the Program Files (x86) this time however, dont enter the folder named PDM, just copy the first folder seen/found

21) Do step 9 but for the other registry file, ofcourse after navigating to the correct directory in step 7

22) Congrats you finished
