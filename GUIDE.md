## Steps to activate

1) Disable your internet, this is to stop the software from running checks on itself during installation

3) Extract the zip file to a easy to access location, the zip files password is 123

4) Enter the folder that was extracted and enter the only folder again

8) Cut the extracted folder from step 6 and go to the main installed directory which you chose in step 3, and paste it there, note that you may get a error where to files are the same, click replace if the error pops up

9) Enter the folder and locate the registry entries, right click the networks_serial_licensing first and click merge, click allow if prompted, you are supposed to get a success message, if not open a issue please

12) Navigate to the location set at step 3 and do step 4 again, and extract the ISO/DVD file we checked at step 5 into the same directory

19) Go to the location in step 7 and locate the Program files folder enter it, and you should see another folder, enter that folder then copy its contents and paste it to the corresponding folder in the C:\ drive, so Program Files contents should go to C:\Program Files made by solidworks installer and should replace all files and same thing for the Program (x86)

20) Repeat step 19 but for the Program Files (x86) this time however, dont enter the folder named PDM, just copy the first folder seen/found
