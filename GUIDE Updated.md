Leave a Star please ðŸ’–

It is compulsory to have a activated license of Microsoft Excel, you may crack it, but SolidWorks requires it to be functional and usable.

I'm really happy that this is the top repo when searched up on google, BUT can you please check out my other projects?

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Preparation
- Disable your internet connection to prevent the software from performing online checks during installation.
- Temporarily disable your antivirus software to avoid potential conflicts with the installation files. Be cautious and ensure you re-enable your antivirus immediately after completing the installation.

### Step 2: Extracting Files
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a convenient location. The password for the ZIP file is `123`.
- Navigate to the extracted folder and proceed to the 'Normal' subfolder to find another ZIP file. Extract this file in the same directory.

### Step 3: Moving Folders
- Locate three folders within the extracted contents: two containing program files and one labeled 'Server'. Additionally, find two registry entries and a text file.
- Move the extracted folder from Step 2 to the main installation directory chosen earlier. If prompted with a file conflict, choose to replace the existing files.

### Step 4: Registry Entries
- Right-click on `networks_serial_licensing` and select 'Merge'. Allow any prompts that appear. Confirm successful merging; if not, seek further assistance.

### Step 5: Server Installation
- Copy the `Flexnet_Server` folder and paste it into `C:\Program Files`. 
- Run `server_install.bat` as an administrator. If this option is unavailable, open Command Prompt as an administrator, navigate to the directory using `cd`, and execute the batch file using `.\\server_install.bat`.

### Step 6: Completing the Installation
- Return to the original extraction location and extract the ISO/DVD file into the same directory.
- Locate the setup executable within the newly extracted folder and run it as an administrator.
- Follow the installation wizard, accepting terms and conditions without altering serial numbers. Proceed through warnings and continue with the installation.

### Step 7: Post-Installation
- After installation, decline participation in the improvement program and opt to restart your computer later.

### Troubleshooting
- If a DLL file is missing, search for the specific file name online and follow the provided solutions.
- Consider watching the video tutorial linked in this repository for visual guidance throughout the installation process.

## Additional Tips and Resources

### Safety and Ethical Use
- Respect copyright laws and the rights of software developers. Using unauthorized copies of software is illegal and unethical.
