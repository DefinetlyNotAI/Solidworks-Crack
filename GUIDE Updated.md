I'm really happy that this is the top repo when searched up on google, BUT can you please check out my other projects?

## Quick Request

I know the only reason you guys pirate software is cause you got no money, or not enough money - which is why i ask, can you buy me a coffee?
Only if your capable, maybe drop a sponsor? It will allow me to continue this project and crack more software, Thanks ðŸ¤—

Also, for the people who fork the project for no reason, maybe star it before?

## Common Issues

- If a `Could not obtain a license for solidworks standard (-8 544 0)` error pops up, that is normal for windows it is a bug with code [KB3072630](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/ms15-074-vulnerability-in-windows-installer-service-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-july-14-2015-f8098b21-9ab7-a0a6-bddb-a287351f4665) which made windows actually treat Solidworks as a system modification software, Their is no known fix that properly works, I advice using the 2021 version and the use the video - Issue is not from me but the pirated software website hoster itself.


# Installation Steps

### Step 1: Preparation
- Disable your internet connection to prevent the software from performing online checks during installation.
- Temporarily disable your antivirus software to avoid potential conflicts with the installation files. Be cautious and ensure you re-enable your antivirus immediately after completing the installation.

### Step 2: Extracting Files
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a convenient location. The password for the ZIP file is `123`.
- Navigate to the extracted folder and proceed to the 'Normal' subfolder to find another ZIP file. Extract this file in the same directory.

### Step 3: Moving Folders
- Locate three folders within the extracted contents: two containing program files and one labeled 'Server'. Additionally, find two registry entries and a text file.
- Move the extracted folder from Step 2 to the main installation directory chosen earlier. If prompted with a file conflict, choose to replace the existing files.

Folders to be replaced from "Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp" (at setup by default):
```
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\eDrawings  
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS CAM
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS Composer
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS Electrical
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS Explorer
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulation
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS Inspection
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS Manage Client
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS PCB
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS PDM
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS Plastics
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS Visualize
C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS Visualize Boost
```
Folders to be replaced from "Program Files (x86)" (at setup by default):
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\SOLIDWORKS PDM
```
**Note**: This may not be the case for you

### Step 4: Registry Entries
- Right-click on `networks_serial_licensing` and select 'Merge'. Allow any prompts that appear. Confirm successful merging; if not, seek further assistance.

### Step 5: Server Installation
- Copy the `Flexnet_Server` folder and paste it into `C:\Program Files`. 
- Run `server_install.bat` as an administrator. If this option is unavailable, open Command Prompt as an administrator, navigate to the directory using `cd`, and execute the batch file using `.\\server_install.bat`.

### Step 6: Completing the Installation
- Return to the original extraction location and extract the ISO/DVD file into the same directory.
- Locate the setup executable within the newly extracted folder and run it as an administrator.
- Follow the installation wizard, accepting terms and conditions without altering serial numbers. Proceed through warnings and continue with the installation.

### Step 7: Post-Installation
- After installation, decline participation in the improvement program and opt to restart your computer later.

### Troubleshooting
- If a DLL file is missing, search for the specific file name online and follow the provided solutions.
- Consider watching the video tutorial linked in this repository for visual guidance throughout the installation process.
